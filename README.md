##What Is Clean Code?

There are probably as many definitions as there are programmers. So I asked some very well-known and deeply experienced programmers what they thought.

_**Bjarne Stroustrup**, inventor of C++ and author of The C++ Programming Language._

> I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well.

###Beckâ€™s rules of simple code. In priority order, simple code: 
- Runs all the tests 
- Contains no duplication 
- Expresses all the design ideas that are in the system 
- Minimizes the number of entities such as classes, methods, functions, and the like.

###1.Clean code is focused.

- [x] *Without hesitation or unnecessary detail.* 
- [x] *Well-written process.*
- [x] *Can be read, and enhanced by a developer other.*
  
	Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.
